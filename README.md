For details, please refer to [Rivulet wiki](https://github.com/lsqshr/Rivulet-Neuron-Tracing-Toolbox/wiki)

Rivulet is a Matlab GUI App for automatic reconstruction of single neuron cells. It is capable of automatic filternig 3D microscopic image stacks, segmenting neuron structures, reconstructing soma surface and neuron tracing. It has direct communication between the GUI interface and the Matlab workspace. It is currently actively being maintained and updated.

Please cite the following paper for research use of Rivulet:

For questions and bug reporting please post all in [Issues](https://github.com/lsqshr/Rivulet-Neuron-Tracing-Toolbox/issues) with the approperiate label assigned.

Pull Requests are also welcomed.

A vaa3d version of the Rivulet tracing algorithm is also available at [rivuletv3d](https://github.com/Vaa3D/vaa3d_tools/tree/master/bigneuron_ported/siqi/rivuletv3d)

We will provide the first ready to install package for different platforms very soon. In the meanwhile, you can also easily [install from the source](https://github.com/lsqshr/Rivulet-Neuron-Tracing-Toolbox/wiki/Compile-and-Install).
