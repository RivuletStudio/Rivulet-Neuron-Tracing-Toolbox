#Deprecated - Pls use the new Rivuletpy library https://github.com/RivuletStudio/rivuletpy

=============================
Rivulet-Neuron-Tracing-Toobox (WIP)
=============================
Rivulet is a Matlab GUI App for automatic reconstruction of single neuron cells. It is capable of automatic filternig 3D microscopic image stacks, segmenting neuron structures, reconstructing soma surface and neuron tracing. It has direct communication between the GUI interface and the Matlab workspace. It is currently actively being maintained and updated.

Please cite the following paper for research use of Rivulet:
